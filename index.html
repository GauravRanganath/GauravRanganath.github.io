                                I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto with a heavy focus in Software.

                                When I'm not busy with school, you'll most likely find me reading a book (I love to read), running around my neighbourhood (my favourite way to destress), or listening to Kanye (if you're not a fan click ctrl/cmd + W pls)

                                    Trying to start my own tech company was the most fulfilling experience of my life. Let me tell you a little bit about it about how it all came together<span id="dots"> . . .</span>

                                    <br><br>
                                    I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur. So when I found out about the University of Toronto Hatchery's NEST program I became obsessed. The only issue was that I didn't have a team or an idea.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Of course I wasn't going to let that stop me. It took me all Winter but I managed to convince some of my closest friends to become my co-founders, revived an old hackathon project, and prepared a pitch for the Executive Director of the Hatchery.
                                    <br><br>
                                    By some stroke of luck and a lot of hard work, we not only made it into the program, but acquired $14 000 of cumulative fellowship funding.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We spent the entire summer working full time on what would become Depactor, a cyber security start up that applied machine learning and linguistic analysis to prevent Business Email Compromise. We developed a machine learning model using scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy to attribute authorship of corporate emails with up to a 95% accuracy using a Flask back-end and front-end built with HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap.
                                    <br><br>
                                    At the end of the 4 months we were selected as one of the incubator's finalists and were invited to pitch in front of thousands of investors at the Hatchery's 2020 Demo Day.
                                    <br><br>
                                    After Demo Day, our team made the difficult decision to call it quits. With the summer coming to an end and the start of third-year we knew that we couldn't manage both our startup and school at the same time. We contemplated pulling a Zuckerberg and dropping out, but quite frankly, we just didn't have the confidence to do it. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Regardless of the outcome, I stand by my statement that founding Depactor has been the most fulfilling experience of my life. I woke up every single day hungry and ready to chase a dream with some of my best friends. One day I intend to start a new venture that I hope will be even more fulfilling than Depactor.

                                    Trying to start my own tech company was the most fulfilling experience of my life. Let me tell you a little bit about it about how it all came together<span id="dots"> . . .</span>

                                    <br><br>
                                    I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur. So when I found out about the University of Toronto Hatchery's NEST program I became obsessed. The only issue was that I didn't have a team or an idea.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Of course I wasn't going to let that stop me. It took me all Winter but I managed to convince some of my closest friends to become my co-founders, revived an old hackathon project, and prepared a pitch for the Executive Director of the Hatchery.
                                    <br><br>
                                    By some stroke of luck and a lot of hard work, we not only made it into the program, but acquired $14 000 of cumulative fellowship funding.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We spent the entire summer working full time on what would become Depactor, a cyber security start up that applied machine learning and linguistic analysis to prevent Business Email Compromise. We developed a machine learning model using scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy to attribute authorship of corporate emails with up to a 95% accuracy using a Flask back-end and front-end built with HTML/CSS/JS and Bootstrap.
                                    <br><br>
                                    At the end of the 4 months we were selected as one of the incubator's finalists and were invited to pitch in front of thousands of investors at the Hatchery's 2020 Demo Day.
                                    <br><br>
                                    After Demo Day, our team made the difficult decision to call it quits. With the summer coming to an end and the start of third-year we knew that we couldn't manage both our startup and school at the same time. We contemplated pulling a Zuckerberg and dropping out, but quite frankly, we just didn't have the confidence to do it. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Regardless of the outcome, I stand by my statement that founding Depactor has been the most fulfilling experience of my life. I woke up every single day hungry and ready to chase a dream with some of my best friends. One day I intend to start a new venture that I hope will be even more fulfilling than Depactor.
