		<p class="bio">
			I am a second year Electrical and Computer Engineering Student at the University of Toronto. While my life and career goals seem to change every few months, what hasn't changed is my love of designing beautiful and elegant solutions to tough technical problems that affect real people. I am most experienced with web, mobile, and application development. I am currently doing my best to explore the fields of Machine Learning and IOT. Apart from my technical experience I continuously develop my leadership skills by taking on executive positions at IEEE U of T, Engineering Stores, and iGEM Toronto. Thanks for checking our my website!
